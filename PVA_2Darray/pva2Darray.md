# PVA 2D array

## Explanation
1. Including Required Headers: All necessary EPICS PVA and server headers are included.

2. Creating the 2D Array:
   - The createPVA2DArray function initializes a 1D vector with size rows * cols filled with 1.0 and creates a PVArray.
   - This array is then set in the PVStructure.
3. Creating the PVServer:
   - A MyPVServer class is defined, inheriting from PVServer. This class initializes a PV with the name BL:2D:Array and assigns the created 2D array to it.
   - The put method assigns the PVStructure containing the array to the server.
4. Running the Server:
   - The main function creates an instance of MyPVServer and calls the run method, which starts the EPICS PV server.

## Compilation and Execution
To compile and run this code, you must have the EPICS environment set up correctly, linking against the appropriate libraries.

## Notes
- This code serves as a basic template; you may need to customize it further based on your specific EPICS setup and the structure of your PV.
- Make sure you handle any potential errors and manage memory appropriately in a full application.
